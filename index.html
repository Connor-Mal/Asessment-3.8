    <br>
    <p>The Rendonulis temple is a strong large scary fortress found deep within the nether, the temple is built on the lava oceans keeping the piglin tribes out.
      <br>
      The piglin tribes are against the Rendonulis becasue the rendonulis captures and scrifices the piglins without mercy.
      <br>
      The temple is guarded by the dead that have been given to the temple from the unknown god if they approve of the sacrifices.

    <br>
    <p>The king of the temple is Rendonulis itself, little information is known about it because the villagers that enter never return and any that do are too traumitized to give much information. Apart from the appearence the blood infused horns, spines of lava and a shadow for a body.
    <br>
    The roar of the king penetrates the soul of anything and the lost piglin souls that were sacrificed are collected. To the sides of the king rise four beasts.

    <br>
    <p>The four Rendonulis beasts are wild ruthless creatures taking a large bite out of it's victim, The beasts swarm their victim giving them no chance of survival with the power of the Rendonulis with them. 
      <br>
      When The Rendonulis minions have defeated their victim, the Rendonulis king will return them to their unknown place untill needed again.
      <br>
      Someone needs to slay this king and it's creatures, the reward well there are rumors of treasures that was stolen from piglins and unsuspeting explorers.
